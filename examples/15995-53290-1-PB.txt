Abstract

A taxonomic revision of Duboscia (Malvaceae) with two species, D. macrocarpa and D. viridiflora, is presented and
used to demonstrate a mechanism for linking from revisions to specimens held in herbaria using HTTP URIs. The
implementation of this mechanism at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (E) is used as an example. Advantages of this
approach include near universal support amongst web-connected devices. Hindrances to widespread adoption of such an
approach are also discussed.

Introduction

Citation of sources is a requirement of good scientific writing. In paper-based publications, references to other
works are designed to be read by a user who will visit a library to retrieve the target work. As journals move
on-line, these references are increasingly hyperlinks of the kind used elsewhere on the World Wide Web. A
reader simply clicks the link to gain access to the target work. Although there are many works still only in
paper form, many publishers and complex copyright issues, it seems likely this way of navigating the
literature will become ubiquitous.

    Taxonomic publications also cite specimens. These references are designed for a human to find the
associated specimen in a herbarium. They typically consist of collector name, collector number and Index
Herbariorum code. Many herbaria are now digitising their holdings and making them available on-line. This
digitisation process often includes high resolution images of the specimens. It seems reasonable that the
reader of a taxonomic publication should expect to click on a reference to a specimen and see an image of that
specimen immediately, just as they do with references to written works.

    This paper contains linked references for specimens stored at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (E).
By clicking on the specimen reference in a web browser or PDF viewer, the user will be taken to a web page
containing more information and a zoomable, high-resolution image of the specimen. It is our intention that
this paper serve as an example of how to link to our specimens, and--should it prove successful--a model for
how other herbaria could provide specimen linking mechanisms. In this paper we concentrate on the linking
method used at RBGE, and we do not attempt to link to the specimens cited from other collections.

Introduction to the revision

Duboscia (Bocquillon, 1866) is a small genus of trees in the family Malvaceae (formerly placed in Tiliaceae),
found in forest from the Ivory Coast to the Democratic Republic of Congo. We follow the APG III (2009)
circumscription of Malvaceae in this paper but note that this is not followed by all authors, for example Cheek
(2007). Duboscia has been placed in the subfamily Grewioideae (Bayer & Kubitzki 2003). We are not aware
of any DNA sequences for the genus and it was not included in molecular studies of the Malvaceae s.l. (Judd
& Manchester 1997, Bayer et al. 1999 and Alverson et al. 1999).

    During inventory work in the Sangha Trinational area (a series of adjacent protected areas along the
borders of the Central African Republic, Cameroon and Republic of Congo), it was noted that there was some
disagreement between the observations of the one of the authors (DJH) and the literature, as to how many
species were in the genus and how to separate them. In particular, the key by Keay (1958) did not work
(Harris 2002), and the number of species in the genus varied from one to three.

    Duboscia macrocarpa was considered as the only species in the genus by Cheek et al. (2004, 2011), Keay
(1989), Lebrun & Stork (1997) and Hawthorne & Jongkind (2006), with D. viridiflora in synonymy. Lebrun
& Stork (2003) subsequently changed their view of Duboscia to include two species, D. macrocarpa and D.
polyantha, which they had previously placed in synonymy with D. macrocarpa. D. polyantha was also
accepted by Louppe et al. (2008), who additionally recognised D. macrocarpa and D. viridiflora making a
total of three species. In contrast, Harris (2002), Sosef et al. (2006), Harris & Wortley (2008) and Wilczek
(1963) all treated the genus Duboscia as having two species, D. macrocarpa and D. viridiflora. These
differences in taxonomic opinion were the reason for carrying out the revision of this genus, as part of a wider
investigation on the provision of botanical information online (Drinkwater, 2011).

Results of taxonomic revision

From examination of material at BR, E, K and WAG it was concluded that the genus consists of two species:
Duboscia macrocarpa and D. viridiflora. In general the two species can be easily separated from each other
with a combination of characters. However, there were a few specimens which proved harder to determine,
and for which the characters seemed to be intermediate. These were typically poorer quality, infertile
specimens, and fallen leaves collected from under the tree. Seedling and sapling specimens were also difficult
to determine with certainty. Floral and fruit characters give the clearest separation between these two species,
although stem and leaf pubescence was often enough to separate them. Unless otherwise stated, colours are
given for dried material.

    The inflorescences consist of 0.5­3 cm long peduncles subtending a cluster of bracts below the pedicels
(which are much shorter than the peduncles) and flowers. When examining the inflorescences, care should be
taken to distinguish bracts from sepals. The petals are extremely small and not usually visible in specimens
without dissecting the flower. The flowers of the two species show a difference in the colour of the calyx in
dried specimens. Those of D. macrocarpa are quite distinct in that most specimens present obvious dense
brown hairs. In D. viridiflora, the hairs on the outside of the calyx are shorter and lighter coloured. The
inflorescences of the two species are also distinguishable by the difference in the length of the peduncle,
which was long and slender in D. viridiflora and shorter and stouter in D. macrocarpa.

    The fruit also provides good characters for separating the two species. The fruit of D. macrocarpa has a
dense cover of stellate hairs, which can be readily seen when examined with a ×10 hand lens, and this fits
some descriptions of the species in the literature that describe the fruit as velvety. Compared to this, the fruits
of D. viridiflora have a more granular or rough appearance when examined with a ×10 hand lens. However,
when the fruit of the two species are viewed with a higher magnification (e.g. ×40), the differences in the
surface textures become harder to distinguish as the granular texture of D. viridiflora under ×10 is revealed as
stellate hairs at the higher magnification.

    Some characters of the leaves and petioles are useful for distinguishing the two species, however they are
best used in conjunction with fertile characters, and when comparing specimens of the two species. D.
macrocarpa tends to have a shorter petiole, less than 1 cm long. The petiole and main stems are covered with
dense stellate hairs and long straight hairs, reddish-brown in colour. In D. viridiflora the petiole tends to be
longer (over 1 cm long) and, along with the main stems, is covered in shorter stellate hairs; straight hairs are
absent in this species. The density of stellate hairs on young twigs can also be useful in separating the two
species. The stellate hairs are shorter and sparser in D. viridiflora and longer and denser in D. macrocarpa.
The differences in the types of hair present can also be seen on the leaves of the two species, with D.

macrocarpa having both straight and stellate hairs on the underside of the leaf, particularly on the tertiary
veins, whereas D. viridiflora only has stellate hairs, which tend to have shorter arms than those seen in D.
macrocarpa. The hairs of D. macrocarpa seem to be lost easily in dried material, with older stems often
appearing hairless; the hairs of D. viridiflora are retained in dried material.

    There were also differences noticed in the texture of the leaves, with the specimens of D. viridiflora often
having a papery feel to them, and a smoother underside. The specimens of D. macrocarpa appear to have
thicker leaves, with a rougher texture to the underside. With sterile material, those characters given above for
leaves and stems are not always clear, e.g. it became apparent when taking measurements of the specimens
that the length of the petiole was often on the cusp of being one side of 1cm or the other, with both species
having some measurements just above, or just below the lengths stated in the description and key. The
presence of hairs is also sometimes difficult to determine, particularly in older specimens, from which they
often seem to have been lost. All these sterile characters are most useful when comparing individuals of the
two species, rather than for identifying a single specimen, because the differences are relative, and most
apparent when specimens of the two are compared side by side.

    Another character used in the literature, is the number of flowers and bracts per inflorescence. The
combination of the number of bracts and flowers was used by Keay (1958) to separate two species of
Duboscia, although this character was later described as "unworkable in both the field and the herbarium" by
Harris (2002). Observations made during the examination of the specimens showed the numbers of bracts and
flowers to vary within each species, and to overlap between the two species so we could not use these
numbers to separate the species.

    As the genus has not been previously included in molecular studies, it would be useful if this were done,
to clarify the position of the genus within Malvaceae. As the two species grow sympatrically and overlap in
habitat type, it would be interesting to identify specimens where there were difficulties in determining the
species, to see whether there is evidence of hybridisation or introgression.

Discussion on persistent identifiers for cited specimens

There has been much debate concerning adoption of identifiers for specimens in biological collections
(Riccardi et al. 2009; Cryer et al. 2009). Here we limit ourselves to describing our own solution, and
explaining why we adopted it.

    Our primary aim is enabling the author to provide a link for reader to access more information about the
specimens that they are citing. The difference between linking to the original specimens used by the author,
and searching for all information about a particular specimen, is an important one. Linking requires there to be
a resolution mechanism that will take the reader to the original source of the data--the herbarium where the
specimen is curated. Searching may return more information, but does not discriminate between the original
source and other resources that (although useful) may not have been used by the author.

    Linking is also an important, machine-readable way for the author to credit the sources of research
materials. The links act as tags, which could be used to discover which papers cite which specimens. In future,
this could also be used to build links from specimens to the papers they are cited in.

    For linking to work, the identifiers used for specimens need to be resolvable via a mechanism that is
widely available and stable for the foreseeable future. If there is no resolution mechanism, or the piece of
software the author is using does not understand the resolution mechanism or fails, then there is no way of
retrieving the original specimen data.

    We started with the premise that institutions, in this case RBGE, are responsible for curating all the
collections they hold, and making them available to the research community in perpetuity. RBGE has already
been doing this for over three hundred years. Today this includes making information, including images and
data, available on-line. Although the institution can use third party service providers it is the one ultimately
responsible for maintaining consistent availability of the data on the specimens it holds. In the last three

26 · Phytotaxa 73 © 2012 Magnolia Press  HYAM ET AL.
centuries, it has not had agreements with suppliers that have lasted more than a few decades, so its
implementation of any solution to the linking problem has to be as independent as possible from any single
supplier, if the solution is to persist.

    Resources are always limited, and so our priority is to produce a simple, easy to maintain system that will
work today and for the foreseeable future. A system will only attract the level of adoption necessary, to ensure
the widespread uptake that will warrant its continued maintenance and eventual migration to future
technologies, if it is shown to be of value now.

    We have therefore adopted the use of Linked Data (Bizer et al. 2009) compliant HTTP URIs (Hypertext
Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Identifier) as our identifier technology. These represent the standard
technology used to identify resources on the World Wide Web. They can be thought of as a subset of the
regular web addresses familiar from the location bar on your web browser, but importantly they follow the set
of recommendations given by the World Wide Web Consortium for "Cool URIs" (Ayers and Völkel 2008).
For our purposes they have four key features:

1. They hide the underlying server technology used to publish the data thus enabling us to change the way
    we manage and publish data without changing the identifier (i.e. they can be maintained despite
    technological and organisational change).

2. They carry out a process called content negotiation. This means the response from our server depends on
    the client who is requesting the information. Someone using a web browser will receive a web page whilst
    a machine harvesting metadata will receive raw data.

3. They will work on all web-connected devices currently available (e.g. desktops, laptops, tablets, eBook
    readers, smart phones) and likely on those to be introduced in the foreseeable future.

4. They depend for their resolution only on the existing web infrastructure currently available from multiple
    suppliers. We could move to a new hosting provider, a new internet service provider or a new domain
    name registrar. The only thing we depend on is continued legal rights to the rbge.org.uk domain name.

    A major hindrance to the widespread adoption of HTTP URIs is a social one. There is a perception that,
because HTTP URIs have been used to identify ephemeral resources, and broken links are often encountered
whilst surfing the web, the technology must be inherently fragile. In fact, it is no more or less stable than any
other identifier technology. For HTTP URIs to be resolvable to original data, the current World Wide Web
infrastructure needs to be either maintained, or replaced by something that is compatible. The same applies to
any other identifier technology--their resolution mechanisms need to be maintained or replaced with
compatible versions. Currently, all identifier technologies use the World Wide Web and HTTP URIs as their
only link to original data.

    The lack of confidence in HTTP URIs is particularly important for publishers who may be reluctant to
include them in publications. We hope that this paper will go some way to correcting this perception, and
encourage other herbaria to adopt best practice in deploying HTTP URIs. In future, it may be worthwhile to
establish a registry of stable specimen identifiers, possibly under the auspices of GBIF. We would welcome
this.

    Should social and technical support for the resolution of identifiers fail, all that would remain is the
identifier consisting of a unique string of characters. In this case HTTP URIs provide an adequate mechanism
for ensuring we are creating globally unique character strings for each of the specimens held at RBGE, so that
they can be found using the search engines of the future.

How to use our specimen identifiers

Our identifiers for herbarium specimens take the form http://data.rbge.org.uk/herb/E00421503 where the part
after the final forward slash is the barcode number which is physically on the specimen.

STABLE CITATIONS FOR HERBARIUM SPECIMENS  Phytotaxa 73 © 2012 Magnolia Press · 27
    The two key principles in citing our identifiers are to ensure that at least the first reference to a specimen
is hyperlinked and that the HTTP URI itself is visible to the reader somewhere in the document if it is printed.
The way we have done it in this exemplar paper is as follows:

1. A reference to the specimen has been cited in the conventional way, as specified by the publication's
    guidelines, and made a hyperlink to the IH herbarium code E, using our HTTP URI as the link.

2. We have included a table that lists our HTTP URIs as the last column.
3. Whenever our HTTP URI are included where they can be seen by the reader they are hyperlinked with the

    URI set as the HTTP URI itself.
4. Our identifiers are always cited in full including 'http://' at the beginning.
5. The identifiers are case sensitive.
6. We have avoided including our identifiers directly in prose text, as this would have made it hard to read.

Implementation Notes

Our implementation of this technology is very simple. We are, like many herbaria, in the fortunate position of
having had a barcoding policy in place for the last 15 years, and so we have half a million databased
specimens bearing unique barcode numbers, and we make data from our current collection management
system available online, so that we have a herbarium catalogue with the equivalent of one webpage per
specimen.

    To implement the identifiers on top of this existing system, we set up a subdomain '/data' of our
institutional domain name rbge.org.uk. This took a few minutes using our domain name registrar's
administration panel and cost nothing. We then set up a website containing a simple script that detects whether
or not a request is coming from a web browser, and then either redirects to the existing web page, or to raw
data generated by second simple script. This was done on our existing web server at no additional cost. The
whole identifier resolution system could be set up in less than a day by a competent web engineer, provided
the prerequisites are in place. Should other herbaria wish to implement a similar solution, we would be happy
to share our experience.

    Our current system does not track version information. The user is presented with the current data RBGE
holds on the specimen not the data held at the time any referring paper was written. Changes to information
about specimens are typically additive (in the form of determination slips) and dated, so we don't see this as
being of major concern. Should versioning become an issue in the future then we would continue using the
same HTTP URIs as identifiers, but return multiple versions of metadata, linked together using the standard
Dublin Core terms: "hasVersion"; "isVersionOf"; "replaces"; and "isReplacedBy" (DCMI Usage Board,
2012).

    In the UK the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) has created a policy
framework on research data that sets out a series of expectations for how institutions should manage their data
(EPSRC, 2011). Expectation number 5 refers to the use of "robust digital object identifiers" for digital objects.
It seems likely to us that other funding bodies will follow EPSRC's lead, and have similar expectations of the
institutions they fund. We believe that the linking mechanism proposed here can provide a simple but suitably
robust mechanism for herbarium specimens.
